[{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Welcome to my website! I am currently a doctoral student in the Earth System Modelling group at the Technical University of Munich, where I am supervised by Prof. Dr. Niklas Boers. Previously, I was a research assistant at the Open Geographic Modeling and Simulation (OpenGMS) group at Nanjing Normal University, where I worked under the supervision of Prof. Dr. Min Chen.  Read more... My research is driven by my passion for merging geospatial technologiesüõ∞Ô∏è, such as geoinformatics and remote sensing, with advanced data-driven approaches such as machine learning and deep learningü§ñ. I\u0026#39;m also interested in assessing the developed models beyond their accuracy, including generalisation, explainability, interpretability, and reproducibility. My overall goal is to use these interdisciplinary methodologies to explore and deepen our understanding of the interactions between human and Earth systems, contributing to their sustainability in the Anthropocene eraüåç. My academic journey can be summarised in two main areas of focus: (1) examining sustainable urban environments at various scales, encompassing infrastructure and landscapes, in response to climate change, and (2) investigating the interactions between (human-influenced) forest ecosystems and climate impacts.\nPlease feel free to explore this website where you can find my Full CV, the latest news about my worküíª, a list of my publicationsüìë, as well as datasets and codesüìÄ that I have made available to the academic community.
